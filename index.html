<h3> Welcome to my Bio!</h3>
<a href ="greetings.png"><img src="greetings.png" alt="Greetings"></a>

<p>My name is Benjamin and I am a nerd at heart. I enjoy playing board games, video games, and tinkering with anything mechanical. <br>
If you are feeling up to the challenge of dueling me in Risk or Monopoly or maybe even a Slayer battle in Halo, I would answer with glee and excitement. <br>
May the games......begin :)</p>
